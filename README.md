Data Structure Projects in C++ from UC Davis course ECS 36C: Data Structures and Algorithm, including:
- Binary search: use iterative and recursive binary search to look up an item with specific IDs in the database, and compare the speed of the two searching methods
- Minimum heap: design heap data structure class with priority queue to implement pop, push, and getMin for grouping a large dataset
- Sorting: implement insertion, merge, and quick sort and keep track of the run time and comparisons between each sorting algorithm
- AVL tree design: design an AVL tree class that implements left/right rotation, self-balance mechanism, and BST traits
